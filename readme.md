# Gulp + BrowserSync

This is a very basic gulp build intended to replace the often frustrating live reload. No more messing with express server settings or browser extensions.

## Instructions

clone the repo
npm update - to install app dependencies
start a local server - python -m SimpleHTTPServer
run 'gulp' from command line

## Development Notes
* Jade for HTML pre-processing
* Compass for CSS pre-processing
* Gulp to manage tasks
* BrowserSync for a sexy live reload

## Planned Updates
* Incorporate Compass watch into gulp build
* Add front-end framework (foundation / bootstrap )
* Incorporate Angular
* Add development server
